Welcome to the OpenLane Maven Basics Demo Project

What is Maven Basics Project?

	We tried to assemble user documentation and developer information here. 
We are excited you have time to visit this site.
This is a sample maven project that is intended to serve as a template to other OpenLane projects. In this project some maven best practices are included. We hope you enjoy this site. 

	Thank you.
